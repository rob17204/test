<meta name="description" content="Oral systemic education- The process of identifying high-risk pathogens and high-risk patients all while understanding the inflammatory and genetic links connecting them to chronic disease.  A new standard for dental education has emerged based on current and relevant evidence.  Medical histories take on a new meaning, therapy targeted to both local biomes and systemic micro-biomes, antibiotic stewardship principles may surprise you, and the business model will grow your practice. Dr. John Kempton DDS FACD FAAOSH has the knowledge, collaborative background and experience, to speak to your dental practice or group on these topics.">

                                    <p>The <em>COVID-19</em> pandemic of the past eighteen months has educated the adult patient population to understand the concept of immune compromised.  Patients can better comprehend what systemic conditions have compromised their immunity and how this situation places their wellness at risk.  Additionally, healthcare providers have become hypersensitive to systemic pathogenic insults to their patients.  In general they have responded by protecting and supporting the immune system during the insult while fighting the pathogenic initiator.</p>
                                    <p>To date, the response has been reactive; it is timely for dentistry to be a proactive collaborator and partner in an intentional and strategic plan to strengthen the human immune system in the compromised patient.</p>

This patient care opportunity offers dental practices new growth strategies and offers dentistry primary care status as we collaborate with peer physicians in behalf of patient wellness.

                                    <p>For about 100 years now, dentistry has held periodontal architecture as a primary diagnostic indicator for periodontal disease and mechanical debridement as the primary and foundational therapy to treat this disease.  This standard of care no longer holds up to current evidence regarding the pathogens that are causal to the disease and its systemic ramifications.</p>
                                    <p>After conventional periodontal therapy, 86% of patients are still positive for pathogenic microbes.  SRP is no longer adequate as definitive treatment for periodontitis.</p>
                                    <p>The medical science model for diagnosing a bacterial disease has long been based on a laboratory test that identifies the specific pathogens at work in the host.  Subsequent target therapy is then accurately based on information specific to the pathogens identified in the lab test.  Why has dentistry lagged behind our medical colleagues and can we more effectively treat both the local and systemic impact of these organisms.  <strong>The course is a one or 2 hour event.</strong></p>
