                              <p>Research during the COVID pandemic has found that oral and pharyngeal gargling with an antimicrobial rinse lowers the incidence of hospitalization among those who may test positive for the virus.</p>

          		            <p><strong>CTx4 by CariFree- </strong> A dilute flavored solution of sodium hypochlorite, xylitol, and fluoride, at an alkaline pH. Very effective and not acidic.  May be the most effective and preferred product that is ideal for resistant periodontal cases, smokers, and diabetics.  For routine periodontal maintenance; use two months after primary care, then switch to Profresh, Therasol, Trilogy, Listerine, or Crest Pro-health.  Dentists and patients can order direct from <a href="http://www.carifree.com" target="_blank">carifree.com</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/carifree" target="_blank">amazon.com/carifree</a>.</p>

          		            <p><strong>Therasol by OraTec- </strong> Product is composed of 2 compounds; <i>alkyl dimethyl amine oxide</i> and <i>alkyl dimethyl glycine</i>.  These synergistic compounds are classified as amphoteric, quaternary surfactants.  Tests have shown Therasol's antimicrobial activity to be close to equivalent to a 0.5% chlorohexidine solution and capable of maintaining its activity for up to six hours.  Dentists can order online at <a href="http://www.oratec.net"target="_blank">oratec.net</a>, patients go through dental offices.</p>

                              <p><strong>Listerine </strong>is an effective over-the-counter product to reduce oral high-risk pathogens.  Its antimicrobial formulation is based on four essential oils.  It is available with and without alcohol.</p>

                              <h2><strong><u>Home-made effective antimicrobial rinse</u></strong></h2>

                              <p>The following recipe is public knowledge and is based on the Slots' research several years ago on the use of sodium hypochlorite [ NaClO- bleach] for biofilm mitigation at a low cost.  Note that the CTx4 product above is based on a sodium hypochlorite formulation.  Should any patient elect to use a formulation like this, it must be done while periodontal disease and/or bleeding gums are being supervised, and managed by a trained dental team.  Patients would take care to avoid children access to this... or any oral rinse dedicated to reduce high-risk oral pathogens.</p>
                              <p>First read the label on the sodium hypochlorite in hand, or that will be purchased for this purpose.  Patient must know if they have a solution that is 5.25% NaClO or 8.5% NaClO.</p>
                              <p>For 5.25% NaClO- mix 20 parts water with 1 part bleach.  You can add 1 teaspon of Xylitol and a drop of peppermint or orange oil for flavor.  Rinse for 1 minute and spit, 2x weekly, do not brush for an hour, or rinse after you brush. </p>
                              <p>For the 8.5% NaClO- mix 32 parts water with one part bleach.  Same additional instructions as noted above for the 5.25% solution.  Rinse for 1 minute and spit, 2x weekly, do not brush for an hour, or rinse after you brush.</p>

                        <p><strong>Waterpik- </strong> Waterpik Aquarius Professional Water Flosser or the Cordless Water Flossers by Waterpik.  The delivery of any antimicrobial agent is most effective when the product can get under the gum margin and into 'pocket' areas.  All the above rinse products work well with a waterpik except Listerine.  Other companies make similar products for antimicrobial delivery.  Waterpiks can be ordered direct at <a href="http://www.waterpik.com" target="_blank">waterpik.com</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/waterpik" target="_blank">amazon.com/waterpik</a>.</p>

                        <p><strong>Philips Sonicare- </strong> a popular power tooth brush that uses ultrasonic wave technology to clean under gum margins and to some degree, into pockets.  A power tooth brush is not as effective as a waterpik, but is better than nothing for a non-compliant patient.  The patient simply fills mouth with the rinse product and uses the sonic brush to potentially 'drive' the product under gum margins and into pockets.  Can be ordered at <a href="https://www.usa.philips.com/c-m-pe/electric-toothbrushes" target="_blank">www.usa.philips.com/electric-toothbrushes</a>, or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/s/ref=sr_nr_p_89_0?fst=as%3Aoff&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Aphilips+sonicare%2Cp_89%3APhilips+Sonicare&keywords=philips+sonicare&ie=UTF8&qid=1519592355&rnid=2528832011" target="_blank">www.amazon.com/health/sonicare</a>.</p>

                        <p><strong>Oral-B power brush- </strong> same appropriate discussion as noted for sonicare power brushes.  Oral-B power brushes are based on a different technology than the above, but are very effective in reaching below the gum line to certain depths.  Can be ordered direct at <a href="https://oralb.com/en-us/products/electric-toothbrushes" target="_blank">www.oralb.com/shop</a>, or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_nr_n_1?fst=as%3Aoff&rh=n%3A3778341%2Ck%3Aoral-b+electric+toothbrushes&keywords=oral-b+electric+toothbrushes&ie=UTF8&qid=1491785840&rnid=2941120011" target="_blank">www.amazon.com/oral-b-toothbrushes</a>.</p>
